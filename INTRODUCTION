When I found GitHub,
immediatly saw the opportunity of show my progress on the programming on Tia Portal
more specifically on Structured Control Language (SCL),
and to see the progress with by the hand with Factory I/O,
and that's the reason of this repository, from the beginning,
the idea would be just solve the scenes that the software sets out,
at the end of that path maybe revisit the solutions and make it better
