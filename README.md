# Introduction.
When I found GitHub,
immediatly saw the opportunity of show my progress on the programming on Tia Portal
more specifically on Structured Control Language (SCL),
and to see the progress with by the hand with Factory I/O,
and that's the reason of this repository, from the beginning,
the idea would be just solve the scenes that the software sets out,
at the end of that path maybe revisit the solutions and make it better.
# FACTORY-I-O-
Factory I/O is a 3D factory simulation for learning automation technologies. Designed to be easy to use, it allows to quickly build a virtual factory using a selection of common industrial parts. Factory I/O also includes many scenes inspired by typical industrial applications, ranging from beginner to advanced difficulty levels.

The most common scenario is to use Factory I/O as a PLC training platform since PLC are the most common controllers found in industrial applications. However, it can also be used with microcontrollers, SoftPLC, Modbus, among many other technologies.
